  **Working of the major components**
  
The whole application is based on node.js which is a platform built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. It can handle large amount of simultaneous connections in a non-blocking manner, is light weight and efficient.

To establish connection between browser and server socket.io library is used. The functionalities of joining room, sending messages across rooms,  raising hand,  glowing of video by voice recognition, listing of participants are all performed using this.

For sharing the video streams peer.js library is used which wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a peer-to-peer connection API. A peer will be equipped with an ID and can create a media stream connection to a remote peer.

For all the storage purposes MongoDB is used a the database.  As mongoDB is a NoSQL database, it supports rapid development cycles needed for the application. The documents in it are JSON files which are human readable, natural form to store data and both structured and unstructured information can be stored in the same document. This document data model is a powerful way to store and retrieve data that makes development fast.
